# ML Unsupervised Learning Workshop

Welcome to the ML Unsupervised Learning Workshop repository! In this workshop, you will explore the exciting field of machine learning with a focus on unsupervised learning techniques. This repository contains hands-on exercises for three fundamental unsupervised learning methods:

1. **K-Means Clustering**
2. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, these exercises are designed to provide you with practical experience and insights into these unsupervised learning algorithms.

## Overview

Machine learning is a powerful tool for extracting patterns and insights from data. Unsupervised learning allows algorithms to identify hidden structures in the data without the need for labeled examples. This workshop will cover the following unsupervised learning methods:

- **K-Means Clustering:** A partitioning method that divides a dataset into 'k' distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters).
- **DBSCAN:** A density-based clustering algorithm that groups together data points that are close to each other and marks outliers as noise.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining as much of the original variance as possible.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the workshop, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required Python libraries by running:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Darshan0629/ml-unsupervised-learning-workshop.git
cd ml-unsupervised-learning-workshop
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Now you're ready to dive into the workshop content!

## Workshop Content

The workshop is organized into several Jupyter Notebooks covering different aspects of K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, and PCA. Each method has its dedicated notebook with explanations, code snippets, and exercises to reinforce your understanding.

1. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Introduction to K-Means
   - Applying K-Means to a sample dataset
   - Evaluating K-Means performance

2. **DBSCAN**
   - Understanding DBSCAN parameters
   - Applying DBSCAN to a sample dataset
   - Visualizing DBSCAN results

3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Overview of PCA
   - Applying PCA to reduce dimensionality
   - Visualizing PCA-transformed data

## Getting Started

Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to follow along with the workshop. Each notebook contains explanations, code snippets, and exercises for the respective unsupervised learning method.
